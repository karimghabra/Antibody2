   T4 = 120, T3 = 2, TSH = 5.
2. Updated version number to 1.2.

2015-05-25:
1. Extended default T4 Y-axis to 120.

3. Turned on normal range by default.
4. Fixed a bug where normal range turns off after a run.
5. Fixed a bug where recalculating IC didn't work.

2014-09-01:
1. Fixed a phenomenon where simulated values did not start at steady state.
2. Added a "close" button within "About" and "Example".

2014-02-23:
1. Changed p48/VTSH to 4.3.
2. Tooltip now shows hormone values more prominently.
3. Added button to toggle normal range of each hormone.

2013-11-09:

2. Updated jQuery to 1.10.2.
3. Tooltip showing both x and y values when hovering over a point.
4. Hovered point is made more visible with a highlighting circle.
5. Simplified the object handling server responses and made it more
   general.
6. y-axis uses SI units for large numbers, ie 1,200 -> 1.2k.

2013-07-25:
1. Next run color is automatically changed.

2013-07-22:
1. "DIRECTIONS" and "EXAMPLE" now work with touch devices.

7. Added a tooltip explaining how comparison works.
8. Fixed a bug where simulation time wasn't correctly validated.
9. Upper limit of simulation time is now 100 days.
10. Properly uses jQuery's "prop" function to set properties like "disabled".

2013-05-21:
1. Added an option to (re)calculate initial conditions when making a run.

2013-05-12:
1. Checks userAgent for 'msie' and display not-for-IE message.

2013-04-30:
1. The hack where body onload makes an ajax call to cgi-bin/getplot.cgi
   to get the bare minimum JSON skeleton to graph an empty graph is gone.
   Ability to graph an empty graph is now done in js/ajaxfun.js.
2. Overlay ability: User can choose to graph as Blue or Green line
   (Default is Blue line). This is so the user can compare two simulations.

2013-04-18:
1. p47 was changed again to 3.2.

2013-03-07:
1. getinit2.m and thysim2.m now only handles units in mols. Conversion to
   displayed units is done at the end, in a THYSIM->postProcess().
2. Value of p47 (estimated blood compartment volume) is now back to 3.

2013-01-29:
1. Some parameter values were changed, and the parameter changes are made
   in getinit2.m and thysim2.m. These changes allowed steady state T4, T3, and
   TSH values to be closer to the expected average.
2. Protovis changes:
 a. Loads an empty graph onload.
 b. Hovering over the graph shows the y-value. For very large datasets, this 
    can lag the browser. Perhaps looking in limiting resolution, as in, the
    number of points sent back from the server to the browser. If this can be
    done in Octave, it would potentially decrease processing time, as Octave
    result processing can take a while.

2012-11-06
1. UI:
 a. This version added animation for when adding pill, IV, and infusion inputs.
 b. Also created the framework for rollover info boxes.
2. Server-side:
 a. Created the framework for using pre-calculated initial conditions, at least for
    default secretion/absorption values.

2012-10-30
1. This version does not have animation.
2. This version also does not have pre-calculated starting values.

2012-05-17
1. We decided to move the secretion/absorption on hover scroll bars from within
   the main diagram to its own little section. The subsequent change to CSS would
   be major and justifies this move.

2012-04-09
1. This version was developed around REDIPS drag and drop, but we decided to no
   longer do drag and drop.
